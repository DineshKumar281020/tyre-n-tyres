                <!-- Text Section -->
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h2 class="service-title text-center">What Is A <span>Tyre</span>?</h2>
                    <p class="service-text text-center">A tyre is a composite product, i.e. a high precision stationary
                        assembly of
                        materials that has widely differing properties.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The main sub assemblies making up the tyre are as follows</p>
                    <p class="service-paragraph">An innermost stet of airtight synthetic rubber, which performs the
                        “inner tube” function.

                        The carcass ply, made up of thin textile fiber cables, laid out in straight lines and bonded
                        into the rubber. These cables are largely responsible for determining the strength of the tyre
                        structure. The carcass ply of a car tyre has about 1,400 cables, each able to withstand 15kg.


                        Lower filler, which is responsible for transferring propulsion and braking torques from the
                        wheel rim to the road surface contact area.
                    </p>
                    <p class="service-paragraph">Beads, which clamp the tyre firmly against the wheel rim. the bead, can
                        withstand forces up to
                        1,800 kg’s.


                        Supple rubber walls, which protect the tyre against impacts (with kerbs etc) that might
                        otherwise damage the carcass. There is also a hard rubber link between the tyre and the rim.
                        Crown plies, consisting of oblique overlapping layers of rubber reinforced with very thin but
                        very strong metal wires.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="service-paragraph"> The overlap between these wires and the carcass cables form a series
                        of
                        non-deformable triangles, an arrangement that lends great rigidity to the tyre structure. These
                        plies, which cover the whole of the tyre crown, perform a very complex function. First, they
                        provide sufficient circumferential rigidity to prevent elongation under the effect of
                        centrifugal force, and thus ensure a constant tyre diameter under all conditions. Then they must
                        provide, lateral rigidity, to resist sway effects. But they must also be supple in the vertical
                        direction to “drink up” obstacles. To make the crown plies, the metal wires must be firmly
                        bonded onto the rubber. Perfect bonding between these two highly dissimilar materials is
                        difficult to achieve but nonetheless essential.


                        The tread, which is bonded onto the crown plies then sculpted with the special tread pattern.
                        Since this is the part of the tyre that comes into contact with the road surface, it must be
                        able to withstand very high forces, and it must be able to grip dry and wet road surfaces. In
                        addition, it must resist wear and abrasion, and it must not overheat. Once the tread has been
                        fitted and sculpted, the whole assembly is vulcanized for maximum solidity.

                        lies on the circumference of the bolt circle.</p>
                    <p>The important measurement is the "pitch circle diameter" (PCD), usually expressed in millimeters,
                        although inches are sometimes used. For a 4- or 6-bolt car, this measurement is merely the
                        distance between the center of two diametrically opposite bolts. In the 4-bolt picture below,
                        this would be the distance between holes #1 and #4. Some basic geometry is needed to find the
                        center of a 5-bolt pattern: draw a line between any two neighboring bolts, and draw a line from
                        the midpoint of this line to the opposite bolt. Repeat with a different set of three bolts, and
                        the two long lines will cross in the center, thereby making the distance between this
                        intersection and the center of a bolt the radius of the bolt circle.</p>
                    <p>The PCD can be calculated for any wheel from the number of bolts (n) and the measured center
                        distance between two adjacent bolts (d) as; PCD = d / SIN(π/n).</p>
                    <p>A 1974 MG B is a 4/4.5" (4/114.3) car, meaning it is, again, a 4-bolt pattern with a 4.5" or
                        114.3 mm bolt circle.</p>
                    <p>The most common PCD values are 100 mm and 114.3 mm. This difference arises from the
                        manufacturers' measurement convention - whether they are designing around metric values (100 mm)
                        or imperial values (4.5 inches, i.e. 114.3 mm).</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Another thing to consider when new wheels are purchased is proper lug nuts or bolts. They are
                        usually either flat, tapered (generally at 90degrees), or ball seats, meaning the mounting
                        surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively. For example, most Hondas have ball lug
                        seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. If you buy
                        aftermarket wheels for a Honda make sure you get the proper lug nuts for the wheel or the wheel
                        will not be properly centered. Some manufacturers (e.g. Nissan) have used taper lug nuts for
                        steel wheels and flat seated lug nuts for alloy wheels.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Some aftermarket wheels will only fit smaller lug nuts, or not allow an ordinary lug nut to be
                        properly torqued down because a socket will not fit into the lug hole. Tuner lug nuts were
                        created to solve the problem. Tuner lug nuts utilize a special key to allow removal and
                        installation with standard lug wrench or socket. The design of tuner lug nuts can range from
                        spline drive to multisided, and are sometimes lightweight for performance purposes. A variation
                        is the "locking wheel nut", which is almost universally used for alloy wheels in the United
                        Kingdom. One standard lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and
                        unique key (typically a computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and remove the nut. This
                        helps to discourage theft of wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which grip
                        the head of the locking nut using a hardened left-hand thread. The success of these depends on
                        whether there is room to use it in the lug hole, and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a
                        free-spinning outer casing to the locking</p>

                        hub-mounting surface to the rim's true centerline. A positive offset means the hub-mounting
                        surface is closer to the outside edge of the wheel; a negative offset means the hub-mounting
                        surface is closer to the inside edge of the wheel. Offset affects the scrub radius of the

                        tires are fitted which are significantly wider than those specified by the manufacturer, a
                        compromise may have to be adopted whereby a wheel with less offset is used to prevent the tire

                        height to width: 70 percent; rim diameter: 14". Therefore a 185/70R14 has the same rim diameter

                        the mounting hub of the car. Factory wheels have a centerbore that matches exactly with the hub
                        to reduce vibration by keeping the wheel centered. Wheels with the correct centerbore to the car
                        they will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the lug

                        with "hubcentric rings" that lock into the back of the wheel to adapt a wheel with a larger

                        The offset of a wheel is what locates the tyre and wheel assembly in relation to the suspension.
                        More specifically, it is the measured distance between the hub mounting surface and the centre
                        line of the wheel. Below is an explanation of the various tyres of offsets which are pictured in

            <h2 class="text-center">What are Speed Rated Tyres?</h2>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>There’s been a lot of talk about speed rated tyres. With the increasing customer interest in high
                    performance tyres – cars – and driving, in general – speed rated tyres are gaining in recognition
                    and, as a result, importance.</p>
                <p>So it makes good sense to understand what speed rating really is – which tyre is speed rated – and
                    what kind of claims can be realistically be made for and about speed rated tyres.</p>

                <h3>Speed rating originated in Europe</h3>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Many places in Europe speed limits are substantially higher than any where else in the world. In
                        some countries speed limits don’t even exist. Probably the most well known example of this is
                        the German Autobahn.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these varying and non-existent speed limits, law enforcement and government
                        agencies needed some way to be certain that vehicles, tyres and wheels would perform safely and
                        satisfactorily at predetermined categories of speed.</p>
                    <p>The best way to do this was to somehow rate the tyre, wheel and vehicle combinations, according
                        to their abilities to perform satisfactorily and safely at predetermined and possibly prolonged
                        speed driving.</p>
                    <p>So in simple words speed rating can be described as “an alphabetical system of describing a
                        tyre, wheel and vehicle’s potential to travel at established and predetermined speed’s”</p>
                    <p>Notice two things in speed rated tyres</p>
                    <p>One – The word fast is not mentioned. Speed rating, regardless of which category they occupy,
                        is not an approval to go fast.</p>
                    <p>Two – Tyres aren’t in this by themselves. Speed rating includes tyre, wheel and vehicle
                        capabilities.</p>

                        <p>To clear up another possible misunderstanding, here’s a question and then the answer.</p>
                        <p>Q – Are speed rated tyres required for, why pay for some thing which is not required?</p>
                        <p>A – Tyres are a combination of every thing that goes into them, and each component serves to
                            do more than just one accomplished. Tyres that are manufactured to pass speed ratings
                            include such a degree of precision that the responsiveness, traction control and overall
                            handling of the tyre is much greater and much predictable that can be found in most
                            non-speed rated tyres. Apart from this the speed rated tyres are more precise and are more
                            capable of passing exacting performance demands than the other tyres. Note that a speed
                            rated tyre is always wanted by a person who wants</p>

                        <h3>Lapse Time</h3>
                        <p>Within all steering systems, there’s a built in lapse time between the moment you turn the
                            steering wheel and the moment the car begins to turn, this time lapse is caused by several
                            factors, all natural and all a part of the car’s steering / suspension system, including
                            gear tolerances, bushing, shocks, and tyres.</p>
                        <p>There’s a portion of this lapse caused by the steering itself. Another portion is caused by
                            the suspension, and within the sidewall and the basic tyre construction , lies another
                            portion of the lapse.</p>
                        <p>These small time lapses are meaningless when at slow speeds, but for a person who is
                            performance oriented, time lapse can be aggravating. Speed rated tyres are built to provide
                            responsiveness, durability, traction and handling.</p>

                    <h3>Why are the speed rated tyres expensive?</h3>
                    <p>Speed rated high performance tyres cost a lot of money to produce and manufacture, without
                        mentioning the specifics of additional equipment, machinery and manufacturing space and the
                        research which goes into it.</p>

                            <p>One thing is obvious; tyres are more than just round and black. They

                                every car journey. They transmit tractive, lateral and braking forces and contribute to

                            <p>Just imagine what your tyres have to put up with. They have to be

                                and withstand dragster starts, drastic braking, long journeys at high speeds and a lot

                                tyres can cope up with all of this, provided you do your bit by carrying out routine
                                checks, like

                                wheel alingment, wheel balancing and tyre rotation every 5000 kms. This would not only
                                improve

                                your tyre life but also improve the overall drive quality.
